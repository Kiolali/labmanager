LabVIEW HTTP plug-in example

This is an example implementation of the HTTP plugin in LabVIEW. It uses HTTP basic authentication ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication ). The username and password can be changed in the WSRealm.vi. The default value is "dXNlcjpwYXNz", which is the base64-enconding of "user:pass".
